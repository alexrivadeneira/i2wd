### Warmup Exercise

### Using divs

The ```<div>``` is a powerful HTML tag.  We can use it to mark out pieces, literally **divisions** of our website to target for styling:

Add a ```<div>``` to your website.  What do you see when you reload the page?
```
<div> </div>
```
Nothing changes! We have to add content and styling to make use of the ```<div>```

Let's create another custom CSS styling class.  We will call it ```fancyStyle```.  Let's add it to our div:

```
<div class="fancyStyle"> </div>
```
Save and refresh the page.  What do you expect to see?

We have to add some styling to fancyStyle:
```
.fancyStyle{
    width: 200px;
    height: 300px;
    background: blue;
}
```

Save and refresh the page.  Now what do you see?

Experiment with other CSS properties:
```
width: 50px;
height: 50px;
background-image: url("");
border: 6px dotted purple;
border-left: 1px solid green;
```

### Project
Start building your personal webpage.
* Start with the empty HTML document
* Be sure to add a title!
* Add some headers and paragraphs.
* Add an image
* Style some elements

Stretch goals:
* Add some links
* Build some divs and do custom class styling.
