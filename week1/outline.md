### Class goals
* Transition from web consumer to producer/maker/creator

### Changing perspective from web content consumer to producer
* "Peek behind the curtain" with Chrome developer tools.  Right click: "View Page Source"
* Creating an html file.

### HTML Tags
* HTML tags are the building blocks of websites.  Most tags have an opening and closing tag that you can put stuff between (nesting).

This is an opening and closing header tag:
```
<h1> </h1>
```
